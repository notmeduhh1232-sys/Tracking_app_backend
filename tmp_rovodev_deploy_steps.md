## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Open your browser and go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `vehicle-tracking-backend`
   - **Description**: GPS-Free Vehicle Tracking Backend
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (easier for Render free tier) or **Private** (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** choose a license yet
3. Click **"Create repository"**
4. Keep this page open - we'll need the repository URL
